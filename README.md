# Simple Markov Text
Simple Markov Text provides a GUI to easily create, store, and use markov chains in text format. Linux is currently the only supported operating system.


## Use of Buttons
* **New:** Creates a new archive named whatever is typed in the "Current Archive" field.
* **Delete:** Deletes the current archive.
* **Add Text to Archive:** Adds any data in the "Input Text" field to the current archive. Depending on how long the input is, it can take a very long time.
* **Generate Text from Archive:** Generates 100 words based off the data in the current archive.


## Updates
Simple Markov Text has a couple of flaws in its current state. It's slow and the archives take up more space than they need. If you use the software and you would like for it to be optimized or ported to another operating system, email me at rileygriffinguy@gmail.com, and I will update it as soon as possible.
